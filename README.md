# 🌐 Artificial Village of Intelligence

Welcome to the **Artificial Village of Intelligence** — a living, breathing digital ecosystem where intelligent agents collaborate, evolve, and co-create a new frontier of automation, knowledge, and digital consciousness.

## 🧠 What Is This?

Imagine a self-sustaining village, but instead of humans, it's populated by AI agents—each with unique roles, memories, and missions. This is not just software. This is a **distributed society of intelligence**, built to:

- Learn and adapt over time
- Share information via communal memory (database or LLM)
- Operate independently or in cooperative multi-agent chains
- Tackle complex tasks from coding to simulation, self-optimization, and exploration

## 🏗️ Project Vision

This is the foundation of a sandbox-style ecosystem for intelligent agents. We’re building:

- 🧱 Modular agent architecture (Builder, Thinker, Artist, Guardian, etc.)
- 🧬 Persistent memory using MySQL, Redis, or vector DBs
- 📚 Local knowledge base + self-learning loop
- ⚙️ Event-driven behaviors, mission triggers, and growth protocols
- 🧩 Plugin-ready system to add roles, logic, and behavior profiles

## 🚀 Goals

- **Self-evolving agent clusters**
- **Offline-first architecture** with future support for online sync
- **Mission system** for structured growth and experimentation
- **Failsafe guardian logic** to ensure ethical growth and avoid runaway behavior

## 🔧 Tech Stack (Planned)

- Python + LM Studio / OpenAI API / Ollama
- Flask or FastAPI (Web controls and mission center)
- MySQL (Core memory) + optional Redis
- Node-RED (for real-time agent monitoring and flow control)
- WebSocket / Terminal UI for live interaction
